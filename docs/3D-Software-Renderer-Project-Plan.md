# 3D Software Renderer Project Plan

## Phase 1: Setup and Basics (2 weeks)
1. Set up project structure, CMake, and GitHub repo
2. Implement basic SDL2 window and rendering loop
3. Create 2D and 3D vector operations
4. Implement point projection and line drawing

## Phase 2: Core Rendering (3 weeks)
1. Develop triangle rasterization
2. Implement linear transformations
3. Create dynamic arrays for vertices and triangles
4. Add OBJ file loading
5. Implement depth sorting for faces

## Phase 3: Advanced Rendering (4 weeks)
1. Implement matrix operations and 3D transformations
2. Add projection matrix
3. Develop basic lighting and shading
4. Implement texture mapping
5. Add perspective-correct texture mapping
6. Implement PNG decoding for textures

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
1. Implement Z-buffer
2. Add camera controls
3. Develop clipping algorithms
4. Support multiple meshes
5. Implement performance optimizations

## Phase 5: Polish and Extend (2 weeks)
1. Refactor and optimize code
2. Improve documentation
3. Research and implement additional features
4. Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing

## Ongoing Tasks
- Write and maintain documentation
- Implement unit tests using Minunit.h
- Regularly commit to GitHub and maintain the README
- Ensure code follows SDL2 coding style
